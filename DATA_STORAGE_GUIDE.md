# ðŸ’¾ Data Storage Guide

This document provides a complete reference for all data stored in the application, including the Supabase cloud database and the user's local device via **AsyncStorage**.

## 1. Supabase Cloud Storage (`entries` Table)

With the introduction of user accounts, all user-generated check-in data is now stored in a central `entries` table in the Supabase database. This allows for cross-device syncing. The `DatabaseService.js` file handles the mapping between the database's `snake_case` columns and the app's `camelCase` state.

### The Entry Object Structure

| **`status`** | `String` | `Step5_ReminderScreen.js` ('pending'), `CheckInContext.js` ('completed') | The current state of the entry. | **Entries:** Filters between Pending/Completed lists.<br>**Insights:** Filters for completed entries only. |

## 2. AsyncStorage Keys

AsyncStorage is still used for non-critical, client-side data.
